# Document Layout Detection using MonkAI Object Detection Library

Models that takes a document image file as input and locates the position of a set of objects, predicts their labels and confidence scores.

## Choice of architecture
-Inspiration from the blog- https://medium.com/@Intellica.AI/a-comparative-study-of-custom-object-detection-algorithms-9e7ddf6e765e

Yolov3, FasterRCNN & SSD are broadly top 3 model architectures that are used for Object detection. So, for this task, prediction and confidence on inference images of these 3 architectures have been compared.
